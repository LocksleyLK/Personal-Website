This week was very special as last Thursday was Earth Day! I continued sketching for the #VisualGreenTech challenge by Microsoft's Developer Advocacy Team. This challenge is about spreading awareness and taking action this Earth Day. For my blog post, I wanted to compile all of the sketchnotes I have published on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/locksleylk) this week.
