## Question

Identify the global corporation or institution that you have chosen to research this quarter, and say why you chose it.

## Answer

I have selected Microsoft as my client this quarter. I chose Microsoft because I have spent the past couple of months studying the Azure Administrator Associate certifications. During the summer, I earned my Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals certification which championed their commitment to privacy and protection. They also discussed how privacy can be divided into Microsoft responsibilities and customer responsibilities. (For example, it is up to the customer to ensure that their cloud solution permissions are granted with the least amount of access required for people to do their job.)

I am also excited to learn about other aspects of Microsoft outside of Azure. For example, I learned that Microsoft Teams was FERPA compliant while Slack was not. From my research, it seems like Microsoft is a leader in privacy protection which makes them an attractive company to do business worth.

Furthermore, Microsoftâ€™s high commitment to privacy and integrity means that when something does go wrong, it can be disruptive to their customers. I am looking forward to learning more about Microsoft's response to when their security was threatened.
