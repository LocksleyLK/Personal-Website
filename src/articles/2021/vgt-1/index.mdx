During the past week, I participated in the #VisualGreenTech challenge by Microsoft's Developer Advocacy Team. This challenge is about spreading awareness and taking action this Earth Day. For my blog post, I wanted to compile all of the sketchnotes I have published on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/locksleylk) this week.

## April 7

**Prompt**: Complete the Sustainable Software Engineering Module. Visualize something you learned in one image.

## April 8

**Prompt**: "Everyone has a part to play" in sustainable engineering. Visualize it with an example!

## April 9

**Prompt**: Sustainability is enough, by itself, to justify the work! Visualize what this means to you - in one image!

## April 10

**Prompt**: Carbon negative means we remove more CO2 than we emit. Visualize an action that helps us achieve this goal.
