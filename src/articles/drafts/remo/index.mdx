Picture this: a virtual networking event with over one hundred students, most of which have never met each other before. It would be hard to have every voice heard or question answered in one large Teams meeting.

Last week, I had the opportunity to represent Women in Informatics at the University of Washington iSchool resource fair for newly admitted students. What made this fair unique was it used a platform I had never heard of before called Remo.

Remo is the solution to large-scale virtual networking. At our event, virtual tables held up to 8 students. (Although this setting can be adjusted!) Within tables, we could video call, screen share, and whiteboard together. When I first heard about the limit in table size, I was wary that people would be left out. Instead, it kept groups at a manageable size where everyone had the space to network.

What takes Remo to the next level is there are approximately 20 tables on a "floor", making it easy for attendees to move around the platform. Last, but not least, you could hop to different floors. In our event, five floors were used but this could increase or decrease based on the event size.

Over the hour and a half event, we had over 100 people on the platform. At my table, we met with 30 students.

Remo has future potential in the tech space. It would be the perfect platform to hold a hackathon. I am the hackathon Director for Women in Informatics, and my team is looking to use Remo to host our event this January. What makes Remo great is it would allow students to come together from around the world to collaborate and still provide space to network with our team of sponsors and mentors.
