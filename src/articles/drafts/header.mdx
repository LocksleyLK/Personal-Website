# Why have my favicons disapeared for the third time?

## Gatsby.JS doesn't let you change metadata in index.html; here's how to fix it

As I was finalzing the last pieces of my personal website, I had the same problem pop up continuously. I'd walk away from my code and when I returned, my favicons on my front page would have disapeared.

By the third time of recopying and pasting my Font Awesome CDN into my `<head>` index.html, I realized that something else was probably up.

And for sure, after doing some research, I realized the problem wasn't just with favicons. All added metadata was not being saved.
