Last week, I implemented serverless for the very first time in the Seasons of Serverless challenge. I used this Microsoft Learn Module to get started which was very helpful.

One thing I quickly realized was I did not understand fundamentally how different aspects of serverless worked so I thought I would write an article for complete beginners like me to understand it better.
