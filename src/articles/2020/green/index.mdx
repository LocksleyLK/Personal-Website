As technologists, we spend a lot of time behind desktop computers, laptops, and our mobile phones. Although it isn't obvious, these actions do have a negative imapct on the environment. In this article, we'll talk about sustainable software engineering, and the steps you can take to become more eco-friendly.

## <a name='what'>What is sustainable software engineering?</a>

Sustainable software engineering is examining our technology and development practices through an environmental lense.

It is asking questions like:

- How much energy does my technology consume?
- Where are my technology practices wasteful?
- How can I reduce my carbon footprint?

Sustainable Software Engineering is a framework to analyze our current interaction technology today and provide awareness and opportunities to improve our practices to be more environmentally friendly.

## <a name='how'>2. How can I become a sustainable software engineer??</a>

There are a lot of different ways to become a sustainable software engineer, but for our article, we're going to talk about the benefits of serverless.

In a typical compute resource, you have to provision enough servers to accomodate the peak number of viewers. This means that when your service load is light ( nonexoristent), you are paying for and consuming resources that aren't being used.

In comparison, Serverless resources are event-driven. This means that they are only run when triggered. Although Serverless architecture is not the solution for all of your resources, it can be used in specific circumstances to reduce resource consumption, save energy, and reduce carbon emissions.
