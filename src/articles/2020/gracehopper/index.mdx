This year, I am very grateful to have recieved a scholarship to attend the Grace Hopper Women in computing Conference from the Information School at the University of Washington.

I would not be where I am today if it was not for the empowering organizations like Girls Who Code and Women in Informatics that I have had the honor to be a part of. I also have countless mentors to thank for inspiring me.

Although I would have loved to meet you in person, I'd love to connect with anyone attending the event virtually this year. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn, and I'm always free to schedule a (virtual) coffee chat!
