Custom Vision is an awesome tool from Azure. In this article, we're going to cover what it is, how it works, and how you can start using it.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure Account

## 1. Get set up

Go to customvision.ai and sign in. This will take you to Custom Vision's landing page. Select new project.

     (style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;")
/>

To create a new project, we will enter a name and project description. My project is going to be a model that can detect different Washington State hummingbird species. You can use this idea or something else you find interesting. The name I have chosen is **hummingbird-vision** and the description will be **Detect different hummingbird species**.

     alt="New Project Icon"
     (style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;")
/>

If you already have a resource created, select that. If you don't, click the **create new** button. Give your resource a name and select an Azure Subscription.

To select a Resource Group, select **create new** again. Give your resource a name and choose a Server location. I live in the Seattle area so I chose the location closest to me: West US 2.

<img src="createNewResource.png"
     alt="New Project Icon"
     (style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;")
/>

Click **Create resource group.** Now, we need to choose a Kind, Location, and Pricing Tier. I chose **Cognitive Services**, the **West US 2** location, and the **S0** which is the automatic version you can select with an Azure for Students Subscription.

Once your Create New Resource pop-up looks similar to this, click the **Create Resource** button.

     alt="New Project Icon"
     (style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;")
/>

Now, we're back to the first pop up. Custom Vision allows you to create two different types of projects. Either classification or object detection.

**Classification** tags a whole image.

**Object Detection** detects specific objects within an image.

For my project, I need to be detecting whole images so I will be using the Classification Project Type.

<img src="projectType.png"
     alt="New Project Icon"
     (style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;")
/>

In addition to selecting different Project Types, you can also choose a uniqie Classification Type. Either Multilabel of Multiclass.

**Multilabel** allows you to have multiple tags per image.

**Multiclass** allows only one tag per image.

For my project, I need to be detecting one bird per image so I will be using the Multiclass Classification Type.

<img src="classificationType.png"
     alt="New Project Icon"
     (style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;")
/>

Next up is selecting different domains. There are some common domains that you can specifically train for. Washington State hummingbirds does not fall into any of the provided categories so I'll be using the **General** domain.

<img src="domain.png"
     alt="New Project Icon"
     (style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;")
/>

Once your Create new project page looks like this, click **create project**.

<img src="createNewProject.png"
     alt="New Project Icon"
     (style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;")
/>

## 2. Collect and label data

This is the most time-consuming part of Custom Vision. You need to find 20 or more images of each label. For my model, I'll have four different tags for the Anna's, Black-chinned, Calliope, and Rufous Hummingbirds. If you are following along with my demo, check out my [GitHub]() where I have already saved at least 20 versions of each photo.
