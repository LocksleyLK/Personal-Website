As a new coder, it took me learning from an experiened professional that my website's copyright could be automatically updated for me--instead of setting a notification every New Years to update it!

The awesome thing is it is incredibly easy to implement and only takes one line of code:

```jsx
<span>Copyright &copy; Locksley Kolakowski {new Date().getFullYear()}</span>
```

Here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. Unlike `<div>`, `<span>` is an inline element, making it optimial for styling and adding JavaScript to your website.
2. Use `&copy` instead of &copy is important as not all editors support Unicode. (However, Unicode is very prevalent making this less necessary!)
3. `{new Date().getFullYear()}` gets only the year.
