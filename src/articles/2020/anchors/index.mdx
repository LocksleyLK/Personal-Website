After writing my very first long technical blog, I showed it to my twin sister who advised that it would be easier to navigate if I added web anchors.

It was at this point that I realize I had never implemented web anchors before--not in HTML let alone in Markdown.

This is how you do it. In your table of contents, use the following code:

```jsx
## [First Section](#firstAnchor)
```

Use this code for where you want your table of contents to link to:

```jsx
## <a name='firstAnchor'>First Section</a>
```

Here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. My table of contents and section titles use the `H2` header. You may have different formatting on your blog.
2. The class name can be anything you want it to be. Just make sure that they match up.
3. I use HTML for my second code block. Markdown supports HTML so this formatting will work for you!
