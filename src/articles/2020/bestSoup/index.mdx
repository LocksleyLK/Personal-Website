Happy week 5 of [Seasons of Serverless](https://github.com/microsoft/Seasons-of-Serverless)! This time, we're journeying to Korea and learning how to make Tteok-guk for The New Year.

In this article, I'll cover my solution to Challenge 5: The Best Soup!

In this challenge, our goal is to create an automated process to set reminders for each step it takes to make Tteok-guk.

Here are the ingredients (for 4 people):

- Garae-tteok: 400g
- Diced beef: 100g
- Water: 10 cups
- Eggs: 2
- Spring onion: 1
- Minced garlic: 1 tablespoon
- Soy sauce: 2 tablespoon
- Sesame oil: 1 tablespoon
- Olive oil: 1 tablespoon
- Salt and pepper

Here are the instructions:

1. Slice garae-ttok into small pieces â€“ no thicker than 5 mm.
   - You can buy sliced garae-tteok.
   - But in this case, put the sliced garae-tteok into a bowl of water for about 30 mins.
2. Slice spring onion.
3. At high heat, stir-fry the diced beef with sesame oil and olive oil until the beef surface goes brown.
4. Put the water into the wok and boil for about 30 mins with medium heat.
5. While boiling, remove bubbles from the water from time to time.
6. Get the eggs beaten.
7. After the 30 mins, put the minced garlic and soy sauce into the boiled soup. Add some salt, if necessary.
8. Add the beaten egg and sliced spring onion.
9. Serve the soup with pepper drizzled on top.

## <a name='solution'>2. My solution</a>

I used Power Automate for my solution. Power Automate is a service that helps you create automated workflows. Power Automate is a part of Microsoft's Power Platform suite.

A cool thing about Power Automate is it includes a tool called Microsoft Flow. Microsoft Flow [runs on top of Azure Logic Apps](https://www.serverless360.com/blog/azure-logic-apps-vs-microsoft-flow#:~:text=While%20Microsoft%20Flow%2C%20runs%20on,are%20some%20differences%20that%20exist.&text=The%20Microsoft%20Flow%20product%20group,PowerApps%2C%20PowerBI%2C%20and%20Dynamics365.) making it serverless! It is also no-code.

### Input

To begin, I created the following Flow in Power Automate. I'll walk through the solution step by step:

#### Step 1: Manually trigger flow by typing "Begin soup"

#### Step 2: First notificiation is sent

  alt="Microsoft Flow first notification"
  style="float: left; margin-right: 90px;"
/>

#### Step 3: First 30 minute delay

  alt="Microsoft Flow first delay"
  style="float: left; margin-right: 90px;"
/>

#### Step 4: After 30 minutes, four more notifications are sent

<img
  src="/assets/bestSoup/notification2.png"
  alt="Microsoft Flow second notifications"
  style="float: left; margin-right: 90px;"
/>

#### Step 5: Second 30 minute delay

<img
  src="/assets/bestSoup/delay2.png"
  alt="Microsoft Flow second delay"
  style="float: left; margin-right: 90px;"
/>

#### Step 6: After 30 minutes, the final three notifications are sent

  alt="Microsoft Flow third notifications"
  style="float: left; margin-right: 90px;"
/>

### Output

After clicking **Run** in Power Automate and inputting our trigger, you can view the output after downloading the Microsoft Flow app. After running the solution in Power Automate, I would receive Push Notifications on my phone for when to complete certain tasks. I can tell by the timestamps that the push notifications are running correctly.
