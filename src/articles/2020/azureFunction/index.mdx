Hello and happy December! This month, I am learning more about Serverless with the [Seasons of Serverless](https://github.com/microsoft/Seasons-of-Serverless/blob/main/Nov-23-2020.md) challenge.

In this article, I'll cover my solution to Challenge 1.

## Table of Contents

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code downloaded
- An Azure account

## Step 1: Install Azure Functions to Visual Studio Code

To create serverless apps in Visual Studio, we'll need to download Azure Functions.

Go to this [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions&WT.mc_id=academic-10922-cxa), and click install.

If you already have Visual Studio Code installed, this will make it open. From here, click install within Visual Studio. You can check if it works by seeing if the Azure icon has been added to your Visual Studio sidebar.

This is a good time to pause and create some empty folders to hold your Serverless Function. I created a folder in Documents called seasons-of-severless, and inside of this folder, I created a second empty folder called challenge-1.

Now, let's hop back to our Azure Functions page in Visual Studio. It already has some instructions for you to follow but I'm going to cover what I did.

After selecting the create a new project button, I selected to put my project into my challege-1 folder.

I chose JavaScript as my desired programming language and named my function turkeyTime before pressing enter.

I selected Anonymous as my authorization level so that anyone could call my function.
