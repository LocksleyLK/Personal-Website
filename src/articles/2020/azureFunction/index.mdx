Hello and happy December! This month, I am learning more about Serverless with the [Seasons of Serverless](https://github.com/microsoft/Seasons-of-Serverless/blob/main/Nov-23-2020.md) challenge.

In this article, I'll cover my solution to Challenge 1.

In this challenge, we will be entering a turkey's weight to determine it's brine recipe, brine time, and roast time.

### Input

For this challenge, our input will be a turkey's weight.

### Output

There are three distinct parts to our output:

#### 1. The brine recipe

- Salt (in cups) = 0.05 \* lbs of turkey
- Water (gallons) = 0.66 \* lbs of turkey
- Brown sugar (cups) = 0.13 \* lbs of turkey
- Shallots = 0.2 \* lbs of turkey
- Cloves of garlic = 0.4 \* lbs of turkey
- Whole peppercorns (tablespoons) = 0.13 \* lbs of turkey
- Dried juniper berries (tablespoons) = 0.13 \* lbs of turkey
- Fresh rosemary (tablespoons) = 0.13 \* lbs of turkey
- Thyme (tablespoons) = 0.06 \* lbs of turkey

#### 2. The brining time (in hours)

- Brine time (in hours) = 2.4 \* lbs of turkey

#### 3. The rost time (in minutes)

- Roast time (in minutes) = 15 \* lbs of turkey

Using the following information, we'll create an Azure Function to develop a solution.

## <a name='solution'>2. My solution</a>

When creating my Azure Function, I selected the **HTTP trigger**, named the function **turkeyTime**, snd gave it an **Anonymous** authorization level. I used **JavaScript** for my solution but there are lots of different languages you can use. I edited one file to include the following code: **index.js**.

```jsx
// turkeyTime/index.js

module.exports = async function (context, req) {
  context.log("JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.")

  const weight = req.query.weight || (req.body && req.body.weight)
  const responseMessage = weight
    ? `Your turkey weighs ${weight} lbs. 

Brine Instructions:
Salt: ${(0.05 * weight).toFixed(2)} cups
Water: ${(0.66 * weight).toFixed(2)} gallons
Brown Sugar: ${(0.13 * weight).toFixed(2)} cups
Shallots: ${(0.2 * weight).toFixed(2)} 
Cloves of garlic: ${(0.4 * weight).toFixed(2)}
Whole peppercorns: ${(0.13 * weight).toFixed(2)} tablespoons
Dried juniper berries: ${(0.13 * weight).toFixed(2)} tablespoons
Fresh rosemary: ${(0.13 * weight).toFixed(2)} tablespoons
Thyme: ${(0.06 * weight).toFixed(2)} tablespoons

Brine Time: ${(2.4 * weight).toFixed(2)} hours

Roast Time: ${(15 * weight).toFixed(2)} minutes`
    : "Please provide a weight for your turkey!"

  context.res = {
    // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
    body: responseMessage,
  }
}
```

### A note on my solution

- I used `.toFixed(2)` to ensure solutions did not have infinite decimal points. That would have not been the best user experience!

After deploying my code to Azure's Function App, this is what I got:
